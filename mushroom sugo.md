1 large carrot, peeled and roughly chopped

1 celery stalk, roughly chopped

1 onion, roughly chopped

4 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 cup water

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 pounds button mushrooms, quartered

1½ cups dry white wine

1½ cups heavy cream

1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped

Chopped parsley, to garnish


Make the mirepoix: In a food processor, pulse carrots, celery and onions to finely chop. 

In a large, heavy skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Stir in mirepoix, water and 1½ teaspoons salt. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid evaporates and vegetables are tender, about 12 minutes.

Meanwhile, pulse half the mushrooms in the food processor to finely chop. Quarter or halve remaining mushrooms. 

Once mirepoix is tender, add all mushrooms and wine, and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is almost gone, 15-20 minutes. Stir in cream and thyme, and simmer until reduced by half, 8-10 minutes. 

Season with salt and pepper. Serve over pasta, polenta, toasts or whatever sounds like a delicious match for this sugo. Garnish with parsley.
