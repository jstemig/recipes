+ 71 grams (1 cup) instant potato flakes
+ 1 cup boiling water
+ 1 large egg, lightly beaten
+ 130 grams (1 cup) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
+ 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt


Combine potato flakes and water. Let stand until cooled to room temperature. 

Add the egg, flour and salt; mix till incorporated. Lightly knead until smooth.

Roll dough into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle. Cut the dough into 1/2-inch strips, then make snakes. Cut each into 1-inch pieces. Shape with fork tines (optional)

Add half of the gnocchi to boiling water, return to a boil and cook until the gnocchi float to the surface. Cook for 1 minute, then use a slotted spoon to transfer the gnocchi to a wire rack. Repeat.

Let the gnocchi cool for at least 15 minutes.
